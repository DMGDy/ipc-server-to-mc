# IPC using OpenAMP: Communication from backend Server to Microcontroller

This C program will use [OpenAMP](https://github.com/OpenAMP/open-amp/tree/main/apps/examples/linux_rpc_demo)
to communicate information sent from a WASM application to a server down to a microcontroller. The information will 
originate in a Rust struct.
